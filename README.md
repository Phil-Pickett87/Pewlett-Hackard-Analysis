# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
**Overview of Analysis:**
The purpose of this analysis is to determine which employees are retiring as well as which ones are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.

**Results**
  * Retirees in the company: When we first looked at this data, is was clear that there was a large number of employees that were eligible for retirement in the company. In order to fully understand who the company was losing and from which departments, we had to do a deep dive into the employee records to make sure everything was filed correctly.
  
  * Duplicate Entries: One initial problem we were able to recognize is that a number of employees had been listed multiple times. Before our analysis, we can see that a number of employees were listed under multiple titles due to a change in role without an update of their job description.

* Correcting Duplicates: In order to make sure employees weren't counted twice, we corrected the errors by updating the data to reflect only the employee's current role in the company. As you can see, the names on the previous list that held multiple titles now are only linked to one.

* Mentorship Program: In order to determine which employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program, we created a table holding that specific data. This image shows only the first few candidates in the list, however the full table has every eligible employee accounted for!
